# Random forest lab

In this [git folder](https://github.com/student-IH-labs-and-stuff/BER-DAFT-MAR21/tree/main/Labs/Cookies_Lab) you will find 3 csv files about cookies. These rows are gathered via an extended experiment with making batches of cookies. You will also find a jupyter notebook. 

**Task 1) Download and review each csv file in tableau, excel or python - as you can see each batch of cookies varies in things such as sugar, flour, bake temp.** 

To explain the three different files and how they will be used in the notebook :

- Cookies: The training file including the labels of cookies quality. This is the dataset used to build a model that can predict the quality of a batch of cookies
- Cookies_validate: a dataset without the label of cookies quality - this is used to predict the label quality
- Cookies_test: The dataset with the real quality label of the validate set. This data is used to calculate the accuracy of any model run

**Task 2 ) EDA steps, wrangling and a simple supervised model against the provided cookie data sets. This gives us an initial accuracy RMSE (the lower the better)**

**Task 3) As you review the notebook, you might find it helpful for your own learning to add annotations about what is being done at each stage, and add additional cells, functions, charts etc which you feel could be useful** 

**Task 4) Add a random forest regressor model to try to get a more accurate score.**
